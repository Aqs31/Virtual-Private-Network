# Virtual-Private-Network
The objective of my project is to manage the company automation. 
The scope of the project is user can process the data from remote place. 
So any one who can access the data if he/she is working in a concern, but there is some authorization to do process because of security.
 By using the system, the end user i.e. the client can view the process status for their projects.
